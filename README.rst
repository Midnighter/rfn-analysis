Analysis of Flow Networks
=========================

Flow networks robust against damages are simple model networks described in a
series of publications by Kaluza *et al*.[\ 1_, 2_, 3_].

This repository provides a series of Python scripts to extract relevant data from flow networks generated by the `related repository`__ and some
R scripts for their analysis and plotting.

.. _rfn-generation: https://github.com/Midnighter/rfn-generation

__ rfn-generation_

Installation
------------

Please follow the relevant documentation for the installation of external
packages.

This package can be installed like any other Python package but if you only use the extract_data.py script, it doesn't have to be.

::

    sudo python setup.py install

Usage
-----

If you don't want to make a system-wide installation, you can simply add the
location of the package to the path variable.

.. code:: python

    import sys
    sys.path.append("/home/you/location/rfn-analysis")
    import rfn_analysis as ra

With the class definitions imported, you can unpickle the networks.

.. code:: python

    import networkx as nx
    net = nx.read_gpickle("standard/node_robust/sim1025_final.pkl")

Requirements
------------

Python:
~~~~~~~

* some home-cooked `utility functions`__
* networkx_
* numpy_
* scipy.linalg_

R:
~~

* ggplot2_

Optional:
~~~~~~~~~

* extraction and storage of network characteristics in HDF5 files pytables_
* reading HDF5 files in R with rhdf5_
